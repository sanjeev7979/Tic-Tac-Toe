# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game that is simple yet strategically challenging. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking a space with their symbolâ€”typically "X" or "O." The objective is to be the first to align three of your symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
